# Outline

The goal of this is to create a rich text editor which will have the following

- a div which is contenteditable
- a row of buttons which contain the text decoration controls

## Just cursor

- When the cursor is in plain text
  - None of the buttons appear clicked
  - Clicking a button will wrap the cursor in the appropriate element

- When the cursor is in decorated text
  - The button(s) corresponding to that decoration will appear clicked
  - Clicking a button will break the decoration so that the cursor is in between the decorative tags

# Next.js Boilerplate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
